                <p className='InnerPopularDestination2BannerHeading'>Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage along the Nile Delta back to the 6thâ€“4th millennia BCE. Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government.[14] Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest.</p>
