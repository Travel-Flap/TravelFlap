                                Road conditions can vary greatly, and cities are subject to immense traffic congestion.
                                It is also important to watch out for hazards, such as potholes, landslides, and animals on the road,
                                especially when straying away from the major cities. Driving is on the left in India, and there are
                                several regulations to observe in terms of turning, intersections, and traffic lights.

                                the driver should also have held his or her domestic license for at least 1 year.
